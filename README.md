# Hey, I'm Aarav

PM Intern at **Phia** (Series A) — previously co-founded a real estate AI startup and built products across edtech, developer tooling, and consumer.

I like building, talking to users, and shipping fast. Most of my work ends up somewhere between product design and engineering.

Junior at NYU Tandon (Business & Technology Management). Transferred from UC San Diego.

## What I've been working on

**At Phia** — working on growth, personalization, and activation. Shipping applied AI features and improving feedback loops in production.

**At Penseum** — identified onboarding gaps via session replays, reduced time to activation by 30% in 2 weeks, and uncovered top-of-funnel failures that boosted signups +15% WoW.

**At ProperlyAI (Co-founder)** — interviewed 70+ real estate agents, built an AI CRM MVP (Next.js/Django), onboarded 5+ beta clients, and led a team of 5 through 3 pivots. 2nd place at Techstars USC Pitch, selected for NYU Sprint Accelerator.
