# 👋 Hey, I’m Aarav Khanduja

Product-minded builder studying Business & Technology Management at NYU.
I like working where product, engineering, and applied AI meet, and I care a lot about shipping tools that hold up in real user workflows.

I previously co-founded a startup and now build and open-source AI products, with a growing interest in developer tooling and human-in-the-loop systems.

Currently a Product Management Intern at Phia, working on product strategy, feedback loops, and applied AI features in production.
