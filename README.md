# 👋 Hey, I'm [Aarav Khanduja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaravkhanduja)

I'm a full-stack developer and aspiring **Software Engineering Intern** at NYU Tandon (Business & Tech). I love building software that makes a real impact — from helping freelancers navigate contracts to giving homebuyers better decision tools.

I co-founded **ProperlyAI**, an AI-powered **property insight summary tool** for realtors. These days, I’m focused on building open-source tools that combine AI, automation, and clean engineering.
