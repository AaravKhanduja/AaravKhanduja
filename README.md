# 👋 Hey, I’m Aarav Khanduja

Product-minded builder studying **Business & Technology Management at NYU**.  
I work at the intersection of **product, engineering, and applied AI**, with a focus on shipping end-to-end tools while reasoning carefully about real-world workflows and failure modes.

Previously co-founded a startup; currently building and open-sourcing AI products, with a growing interest in developer tooling, human-in-the-loop systems, and applied ML.

I’m also a **Product Management Intern at Phia**, working on product strategy, user feedback loops, and applied AI features in production.
